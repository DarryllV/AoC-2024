## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## This repo

The main purpose of this repo is to share and document my solutions. I'm not sure how far I will make it but i can give it a shot and hopefully I dont die by day 3 or something.
